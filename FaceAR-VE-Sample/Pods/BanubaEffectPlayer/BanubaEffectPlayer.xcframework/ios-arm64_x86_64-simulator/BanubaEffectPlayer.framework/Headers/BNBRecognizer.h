/**
 * @param maxTokens If greater than 0: recognizer will run processing on push-ed() frame only if it can "consume" a token -
 *                   and will wait for the token to become available if all maxTokens tokens have been used up.
 *                   Consumed tokens are "produced" again one-by-one when pop-ping() processed frame(s).
 *                   This mode prevents processing frames more often than a consumer(e.g. renderer) can use:
 *                   potentially reducing energy consumption at the cost of higher latency.
 *                   Only for asynchronous mode.
